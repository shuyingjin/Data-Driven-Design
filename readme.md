Jewerly design

Design Objectives

Shape: Generate a variety of creative jewelry silhouettes or 3D forms.
Pattern: Overlay those shapes with rich surface materials—metal finishes, gemstone patterns, filigree, organic motifs, etc.—to add visual depth.

Image dataset for texture design
Step 1: Scrape a large number of texture images from Pinterest.(<https://www.pinterest.com/>)
        open  Pinterest_Scraping.ipynb
        generate folder: Pinterest_dataset
Step 2: Use the OpenAI API to generate additional texture images based on prompts.
        open openAI_api.ipynb
Step 3: Use the OpenAI API to generate complex pattern images
        generate folder: texture
analyse dataset document: analyse_round1.ipynb

Model dataset for shape design
Step 1: Scrape about 300 models in Sketchfab for AI training.(<https://sketchfab.com/>)
        open gltf-stl.ipynb
Step 2: 3D DCGAN training
        open DCGAN_generate.ipynb
The performance of the trained 3D model is unsatisfactory, and it places significant demands on computational resources.

Image dataset for shape design
Step 1: Scrape about 4000 jewelry images in Usplash for AI training.(<https://unsplash.com/>)
        open Unsplash_scraping.ipynb
        generate folder: bracelat earrings jewerly ring necklace
Step 2: 2. Clean the images: rembg.remove – core function (based on U²‑Net) that strips the background from an image byte stream.
        open background removing.ipynb
        generate folder: bracelet_filter earrings_filter jewerly_filter ring_filter necklace_filter
Step 3: Filter out images containing human body parts (based on open CV).
        open filter1.ipynb
        generate folder: bracelet_filter_keep earrings_filter_keep jewerly_filter_keep ring_filter_keep necklace_filter_keep
        combine into one folder: image
Step 4: Clustering the images (based on KMeans)
        generate folder: clusters
analyse dataset document: scrape-generate compare.ipynb
Step 5: Let the AI study the different clusters and generate different kinds of jewelry accordingly (based on openai api).
        open picture generation.ipynb
        generate folder: generated
Step 6: Generate models based on these images.based on OpenAI’s Shap-E model—specifically the ShapEImg2ImgPipeline provided in the Hugging Face diffusers library—a diffusion-based image-to-3D-mesh generation pipeline.
        open jewelry_generate.ipynb
        generate document:jewelry.glb jewelry.ply
Step 7: Overlay patterns onto these pieces of jewelry.
        open jewelry_sphmapped.ipynb
        generate document: jewelry_sphmapped.glb
The models generated by Shap-E are incomplete, and because this AI’s logic diffuses outward from a cube, the results tend to take on a cubic shape. Therefore, I found an AI model on the Polycam website that can generate more accurate models from images.
another way to generate models by using Polycam AI
Step 1: search <https://poly.cam/tools/3d-model-generator>
        generate document: jewelry_1.glb jewelry_2.glb jewelry_3.glb jewelry_4.glb jewelry_5.glb jewelry_6.glb
Step 2: Overlay patterns onto these pieces of jewelry.
        open jewelry_sphmapped.ipynb
        generate document: jewelry_1_sphmapped.glb jewelry_2_sphmapped.glb
